## Step 1: Prepare Your Slido Poll or Vidcast Video

### Displaying a Slido Poll

1. **Sign Up and Log In**:

   - Visit [Slido](https://www.sli.do/) and sign up or log in to your account.

2. **Create a slido**:

   - Click on **Create slido** and fill in the necessary details.

3. **Create an Interaction**:

   - Within your slido add an interaction, such as a Word Cloud.
   - Set up your interaction and click **Start interaction** to make it active.

4. **Access Present Mode**:

   - In the top right corner, click **Present** to open the Present mode in a new tab.

5. **Copy the Present Mode Link**:

   - Once the Present mode is open, copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

**Tip**: If your Cisco device is not a touchscreen and cannot interact with the Slido poll, ensure that the poll does not require participant input or remove any authentication requirements to allow passive viewing.

### Displaying a Vidcast Video or Playlist

1. **Sign Up and Log In to Vidcast**:

   - Visit [Vidcast](https://www.vidcast.io/) and sign up or log in to your account.

2. **Upload or Select a Video**:

   - Upload a new video or select an existing one from your library.

3. **Access the Embed Options**:

   - Open the video and click **Share** in the top right corner.
   - Select **Embed** to access embedding options.

4. **Configure Embed Settings**:

   - Enable **Autoplay** and **Closed Captions** as desired.

5. **Copy the Embed Link**:

   - Click **Copy Embed Link** to copy the URL with your configured settings.
   - To have the video play in a continuous loop, append `&loop=1` to the end of the embed URL.

**Pro Tip**: The same embedding and looping settings apply to Vidcast playlists. This allows you to display multiple videos in sequence, playing continuously.
